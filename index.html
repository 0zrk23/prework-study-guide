        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Elements are at least in my words objects that the browser uses to construct the webpage</li>
          <li>There are also element types</li>
          <li>Head element containts information about the webpage that the browser will use. This is not seen by the user</li>
          <li>Body element containts the visible content shown to the user, the interactable content as well</li>
          <li>Most of the tags and elements can be observed in the VS for this webpage if needed for study</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is used to add more visual effects to the app</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used to applie styles to an HTML tag (i.e. the h1 tag to give it color)</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet adds style to the webpage, but it does it for all of the elements/tags contained in the internal CSS style</li>
          <li>
            External CSS style sheet is what it sounds like, the styles are in an external file this is called 
            Separation of concerns. Don't forget to link the external CSS style sheet though!
          </li>
          <li>A selector defines the elemnt or attribute you want to apply rules to</li>
          <li>Declarations start with a property and finish with a value. You can have as many declarations after a selector as you want, though they need to be contained within curly brackets</li>
          <li>*: used to apply all of the declarations that follow it onto ALL of the page</li>
          <li>margin: works like the margin in a word doc</li>
          <li>padding: adds space around the content inside an element. It is technically part of an element so when you use it, you are making the element bigger</li>
          <li>header: changes the style of the header</li>
          <li>footer: changes the style of the footer</li>
          <li>if some of the selectors have the same properties, you can select both by separating them with a comma (i.e. header, footer{"code in here"}</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>git works like a tree</li>
          <li>"main" is the trunk</li>
          <li>any feature is a branch that can be updated localy and doesn't affect the main</li>
          <li>git status: command that checks the status of the branch we are on and lets you know of any changes done to the branch</li>
          <li>git checkout -b "branch name": creates a branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds all of the changes to the stage of the current branch</li>
          <li>git commit -m "description of change": commits the changes in the stage to the branch, -m adds a message to the commit</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: this command syncs the local branch to the main branch, i.e. pulls the main branch to the local one if any changes were made</li>
          <li>git push origin "name of the branch you want to push": sends a push request to github so that it can be commited to the main branch</li>
